# RiskDiceSimulator
Simulates a battle between an attacker and a defender in the game of Risk. I play many risk games on www.warfish.com, 
and often times I find myself playing Risk on maps using custom rules. This project is meant to make it easy to simulate
Risk battles using custom rules (attackers using non-six-sided dice, defenders with extra dice, etc...). This tool is
also useful if you just need to see how many armies you can expect to lose in a given battle.

This project is a work in progress. Currently it is command-line driven, but will eventually turn into a Chrome extension
as well as an Android App.

This project is built using Java, RxJava and Gradle.
